# This is a repository for Pentaho's Open Source OSGI bundles

#### A note regarding the introduction of new dependencies:

##### Developers should pay special attention to the two build profiles in the project. These are "lowdeps" and "highdeps".

In simplest terms the only Pentaho dependency that can be added to any of the lowdeps modules is a dependency that is built by another lowedeps module **in this project**. Do not add any other Pentaho dependency to any of the lowdeps modules or you will break the Pentaho suite build. If you need to add a new Pentaho artifact dependency to this project, it should only be in one of the "highdeps" modules and even then, requires review of the Pentaho suite project build order to know if the dependency builds before the "highdeps" profile build of this project.


How to build
--------------

pentaho-osgi-bundles uses the maven framework. 


#### Pre-requisites for building the project:
* Maven, version 3+
* Java JDK 11
* This [settings.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentaho/maven-parent-poms/master/maven-support-files/settings.xml) in your <user-home>/.m2 directory

#### Building it

This is a maven project, and to build it use the following command

```
$ mvn clean install
```
Optionally you can specify -Drelease to trigger obfuscation and/or uglification (as needed)

Optionally you can specify -Dmaven.test.skip=true to skip the tests (even though
you shouldn't as you know)

The build result will be a Pentaho package located in ```target```.

#### Running the tests

__Unit tests__

This will run all unit tests in the project (and sub-modules). To run integration tests as well, see Integration Tests below.

```
$ mvn test
```

If you want to remote debug a single java unit test (default port is 5005):

```
$ cd core
$ mvn test -Dtest=<<YourTest>> -Dmaven.surefire.debug
```

__Integration tests__

In addition to the unit tests, there are integration tests that test cross-module operation. This will run the integration tests.

```
$ mvn verify -DrunITs
```

To run a single integration test:

```
$ mvn verify -DrunITs -Dit.test=<<YourIT>>
```

To run a single integration test in debug mode (for remote debugging in an IDE) on the default port of 5005:

```
$ mvn verify -DrunITs -Dit.test=<<YourIT>> -Dmaven.failsafe.debug
```

To skip test

```
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

To get log as text file

```
$ mvn clean install test >log.txt
```


__IntelliJ__

* Don't use IntelliJ's built-in maven. Make it use the same one you use from the commandline.
  * Project Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven ==> Maven home directory
